	<h2>Fanju</h2>
<div class="p2">
	<p>"Fanju" is a foreign word, which means Japanese serialized or completed animated TV series and special shots, which are commonly used by audiences of animated dramas and animated films. Usually, there are four seasons of animation dramas in Japan every year, which are concentrated in a certain month of January, April, July and October. Therefore, similar to American dramas, fan dramas are also based on seasons, usually one episode per week, with 12-13 episodes (seasonal episodes) or 23-25 episodes (half-year episodes) in a season.</p>
</div>
<h2>Two-dimensional</h2>
<div class="p3">
	<p>The word is widely used in the ACGN cultural circle as a name for "overhead world" or dream world, which means "overhead" and "fantasy". The essence of "two-dimensional" is still the beautiful world imagined by human beings. "Secondary" is a type of culture, not a style.</p>
